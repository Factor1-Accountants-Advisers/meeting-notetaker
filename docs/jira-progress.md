# Jira progress ledger

Date started: 2026-06-26
Owner: Joseph Guerrero

This ledger tracks Slice 1 Jira implementation items as we complete and verify them in this repo. It is intentionally evidence-focused so David/Benjamin can map commits back to the plan.

## Current implementation evidence

- [x] Phase 1 — Durable backend pipeline stage model
  - Added backend-owned `pipeline_stage`, user-safe stage messages, stage timestamps, processing attempt/error fields, and independent `delivery_status`/`delivery_error_message`.
  - Pipeline now persists stage transitions for queued, transcribing/diarizing, identifying speakers, extracting notes, ready, and failed states.
  - Email delivery now records emailing/emailed/failed status; 401/502 delivery failures are persisted instead of being frontend-only.
  - Renderer polling now displays backend `pipeline_stage_message`, so refresh/reopen can recover from backend state instead of local timers only.
  - Verification: `PYTHONPATH=. .venv/bin/python -m unittest discover -s tests -v`, `.venv/bin/python -m compileall app tests`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run build`, `git diff --check`, and direct model serialization smoke passed.
  - Commit: `5440eec`

- [x] Phase 2a — Speaker identity evidence and false-positive suppression foundation
  - Added transcript segment identity evidence fields for raw diarization speaker, source, confidence, evidence timestamp range/job id, and Unknown reason.
  - Added attendee-first candidate selection: Graph attendees first, organiser/recorder next, controlled expansion only when explicitly supplied; no broad staff matching by default.
  - Strengthened speaker resolution so low-confidence or short-overlap identify ranges stay Unknown with explicit reasons.
  - Added tests for attendee-first ordering, high-confidence evidence preservation, low-confidence suppression, and short-overlap suppression.
  - Verification: `PYTHONPATH=. .venv/bin/python -m unittest discover -s tests -v`, `.venv/bin/python -m compileall app tests`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run build`, and `git diff --check` passed.
  - Commit: `79ebd97`

- [x] Phase 2b — Live pyannoteAI identify smoke
  - Verified local pyannoteAI config is present via `.env` without printing secrets.
  - Verified enrolled voiceprint registry contains Joseph Miguel Guerrero with 3 precision-2 voiceprints.
  - Ran live `/v1/identify` against `backend/var/audio/389c0852-adbf-4e89-afa9-69cf27382f0b.webm`.
  - Provider job succeeded; output included `confidence`, `diarization`, `exclusiveDiarization`, `identification`, and `voiceprints`.
  - Parser produced 8 Joseph identity ranges from 13 identification rows; sample confidence normalized to `0.7`; evidence job id present.
  - `_apply_identity_ranges` resolved `SPEAKER_01` to Joseph Miguel Guerrero with source `pyannote_voiceprint`, confidence `0.7`, and no Unknown reason.
  - Added in-person owner alias handling so local owner id `joseph` selects `josephguerrero@factor1.com.au` without broad staff expansion.
  - Verification: `PYTHONPATH=. .venv/bin/python -m unittest discover -s tests -v`, `.venv/bin/python -m compileall app tests`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run build`, and `git diff --check` passed.

- [x] Phase 3 — OpenAI long-meeting chunking/reduce foundation
  - Replaced single-prompt OpenAI summarisation/action extraction with a 15-minute transcript window map-reduce path.
  - Chunk calls return structured JSON for summary bullets, decisions, risks, questions, and action items; a final reduce pass deduplicates and consolidates final summary/action items.
  - Added bounded chunk concurrency and per-provider cache so `summarize()` followed by `extract_action_items()` reuses the same chunk/reduce result instead of paying/running twice.
  - Labelled transcript prompts now include timestamps and speaker display names; owner prompts require exact speaker display names where available.
  - Added tests for chunk boundaries, labelled transcript formatting, and chunk-then-reduce behavior.
  - Live OpenAI smoke passed with configured `.env`: summary generated, 2 action items returned, cache had 1 entry, owners preserved as Joseph Guerrero and Benjamin Bryant.
  - Verification: `PYTHONPATH=. .venv/bin/python -m unittest discover -s tests -v`, `.venv/bin/python -m compileall app tests`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run build`, and `git diff --check` passed.

- [x] Phase 4 — Delivery reliability foundation
  - Added SharePoint delivery state on meetings: `sharepoint_status`, `sharepoint_error_message`, and `sharepoint_web_url`, separate from email delivery state.
  - Added SharePoint transcript save provider with local locked-folder stand-in plus Graph upload path when `MN_SHAREPOINT_DRIVE_ID`/`MN_SHAREPOINT_FOLDER_PATH` and delegated Graph token are available.
  - Added `POST /api/v1/meetings/{id}/sharepoint` to save the generated transcript artifact without mutating/deleting transcript, summary, participants, or action items on delivery failure.
  - Refactored delivery artifact formatting so email and SharePoint use the same transcript/summary/action output.
  - Added tests proving Graph email failure marks delivery failed while preserving ready pipeline outputs, and SharePoint save records the saved location/status.
  - Local SharePoint smoke passed: endpoint returned `saved`, `file:` URL, and no error.
  - Verification: `PYTHONPATH=. .venv/bin/python -m unittest discover -s tests -v` (13 tests), `.venv/bin/python -m compileall app tests`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run build`, and `git diff --check` passed.

- [x] Phase 5 — MSAL token cache persistence and cold-start recovery
  - MSAL token cache now serialized to `userData/auth/msal-cache.json` after interactive sign-in and after every successful silent token refresh, and deserialized on app startup + new client-application creation.
  - `clearCurrentMsalAccount()` also deletes the persisted cache file so sign-out reliably destroys all tokens.
  - Added `auth:sign-out` IPC handler to clear local session + persisted MSAL cache from the renderer.
  - Added `auth:status` IPC handler so the renderer can check persisted cache existence on cold start.
  - Renderer `App.tsx` now calls `getAuthStatus` on mount: if a persisted cache is found but localStorage is empty, it auto-restores a session from the cached account email so auto-record + email/SharePoint delivery work after restart without re-prompting the user.
  - Sign-out in the renderer now also triggers the `auth:sign-out` IPC to clear the MSAL cache, not just localStorage.
  - API proxy now also injects the Graph access token for SharePoint POST endpoints, not only email.
  - Verification: `npm run typecheck`, `npm run build`, `PYTHONPATH=. .venv/bin/python -m unittest discover -s tests -v` (13 tests), `.venv/bin/python -m compileall app tests`, and `git diff --check` passed.

- [x] Phase 6 — Verification pack
  - Full test suite: 13 tests in 4 modules passing (pipeline stage state, speaker identity matching, long-meeting chunking, delivery reliability).
  - End-to-end pipeline smoke with real stored audio: live pyannoteAI transcription (9 segments), voiceprint identification (Joseph matched, 1 Unknown), OpenAI summary (290 chars, 2 action items), SharePoint local save (file:// URL), no-token email refusal (delivery state correctly refused).
  - All delivery outputs survive failures: summary, transcript, and participants intact after email and SharePoint delivery attempts.
  - Cross-cutting audit: `save_snapshot` called in 4 delivery paths, `set_pipeline_state` and `set_delivery_state` guarding all state transitions. No secrets in tracked files (config.py fields are empty-string defaults). Backend 11 service files, 4 test files; frontend 14 main-process files, 8 renderer screens.
  - Verification: `npm run typecheck`, `npm run build`, `.venv/bin/python -m compileall app tests`, `PYTHONPATH=. .venv/bin/python -m unittest discover -s tests -v`, `git diff --check`, and secrets audit passed.

## Crossed out / completed

- [x] `IN-65` — Spike: MS Graph meeting detection — subscription vs. polling
  - Evidence: `docs/spikes/ms-graph-meeting-detection.md`
  - Commit: `9486bd9 document Graph meeting detection spike`
  - Verification: documentation self-check passed; fresh `npm run typecheck`, `npm run build`, and `git diff --check` passed after the doc change.

- [x] `IN-67` — Host-only gate
  - Explicit organiser-only boundary in `src/main/graph/host-gate.ts`.
  - Integrated into runtime for diagnostics logging.
  - Fixture-verified: organiser passes, non-organiser blocked, excluded events blocked, email-less gate works.
  - Manual recording bypasses the gate entirely.
  - Commit: `e25c4e3`

- [x] `IN-66` — Wire auto-start and auto-stop recording to Graph meeting events
  - Recording state machine with idle/recording/processing lifecycle, idempotency by event key, manual-wins-over-auto conflict resolution.
  - Main→renderer IPC bridge: `webContents.send` for start/stop commands.
  - Renderer→main IPC: `recording:started` / `recording:stopped` / `recording:error`.
  - Auto-stop timer: schedules `setTimeout` for meeting end time.
  - Renderer integration: `App.tsx` listens for auto-start/stop, creates meeting, starts capture, stops and uploads on auto-stop.
  - Graph metadata now flows through detection → auto-start IPC → meeting create/audio upload → backend meeting record (`title`, attendees, Graph event id, online meeting id, join URL, organiser email).
  - Fixed auto-stop renderer callback to read the latest recording session via refs, so upload is not lost to a stale React closure.
  - Verification: `npm run verify:graph`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run build`, `git diff --check`, backend `compileall`, and a real FastAPI smoke for create/upload with Graph metadata.
  - Commit: `1df29d8`, `0000990`, `9b74905`

- [x] `IN-71` — Configure app to run at Windows startup and persist in system tray
  - System tray with status tooltip and context menu (Show / Quit).
  - App persists in tray when all windows are closed.
  - Packaged Windows builds default auto-launch on via `app.setLoginItemSettings({ openAtLogin: true, path: process.execPath, args: ['--background'] })`.
  - Login launch uses `--background` so the renderer is available for auto-recording but the main window stays hidden until tray/open action.
  - Single-instance handling prevents a background login launch from creating a duplicate app; explicit user launches focus the existing window.
  - Settings includes an opt-out toggle; user choice is persisted and prevents the default from re-enabling automatically.
  - Tray menu updates live when recording state changes.
  - Verification: `npm run typecheck`, `npm run build`, `git diff --check`.
  - Commit: `a7db862`, `0630750`

- [x] `IN-77` — Recording status UI
  - `HomeScreen` shows auto-recording status banner (recording / processing).
  - `App.tsx` tracks `autoRecordingState` via auto-start/stop IPC events.
  - Tray tooltip reflects current recording state.
  - Commit: `132cb77`

- [x] `IN-69` — Wire pyannoteAI transcription and voiceprint identification into production pipeline
  - pyannoteAI client fully wired: `/v1/diarize` with `transcription: true`, `/v1/voiceprint`, `/v1/identify`.
  - Live verify smoke run 2026-07-02: transcription returned 9 speaker-attributed segments; voiceprint identify matched Joseph Miguel Guerrero from SPEAKER_01 with confidence 0.7.
  - Parser produces identity ranges with raw speaker, display name, confidence, and provider job ID per segment.
  - Verified in Phase 2a/2b; see commits `79ebd97`, `fd00aab`.

- [x] `IN-78` — Attendee-first voiceprint candidate selection
  - `_candidate_voiceprints_for_meeting()` orders Graph attendees first, organiser/recorder next, controlled expansion last.
  - No broad staff matching by default; candidates only from meeting metadata + explicit expansion set.
  - Verified in Phase 2a; commit `79ebd97`.

- [x] `IN-79` — Controlled voiceprint candidate expansion
  - Added second-pass controlled expansion: first identify pass uses attendees/organiser/recorder only; if speakers remain Unknown, pyannoteAI identify is retried with configured key-person expansion candidates.
  - Added config: `MN_VOICEPRINT_EXPANSION_EMPLOYEE_IDS`, `MN_VOICEPRINT_EXPANSION_CAP`, and `MN_VOICEPRINT_EXPANSION_MIN_CONFIDENCE`.
  - Expansion preserves configured priority order, enforces cap limits, and uses a stricter confidence threshold for key uninvited people.
  - Decision note: `docs/decisions/2026-07-02-in79-voiceprint-candidate-expansion.md`.
  - Verified in tests; commit `246ab39`.

- [x] `IN-80` — False-positive suppression for non-attendee detections
  - Segments stay Unknown when confidence < threshold, overlap < 800ms, no identity range matches, or identify fails.
  - Explicit unknown reasons recorded: `low_confidence`, `insufficient_overlap`, `no_identity_match`, `no_enrolled_voiceprints`, `identify_failed`.
  - Verified in Phase 2a/2b; commits `79ebd97`, `fd00aab`.

- [x] `IN-76` — Voiceprint enrollment/admin utility
  - Enrollment wizard records 3 clips with explicit consent, backend confirmation required.
  - pyannoteAI `/v1/voiceprint` called for each clip; opaque provider voiceprint payloads persisted locally.
  - Joseph Miguel Guerrero enrolled with 3 precision-2 voiceprints; live identify smoke confirmed they resolve correctly.
  - Verified in Phase 2b; commit `fd00aab`.

- [x] `IN-93` — Implement MS Outlook emailing of Transcript
  - `GraphEmailProvider` sends via delegated Microsoft Graph `POST /me/sendMail`.
  - Transcript attached as `.txt` file via `build_transcript_attachment()`.
  - Token injection: `api-proxy.ts` attaches `X-MN-Graph-Token` header on email endpoints.
  - Jira-aligned trigger: email is allowed once `pipeline_status == ready`; no finalise/review gate required.
  - Recipient rules: Graph attendee emails for calendar-linked recordings; recorder email fallback for manual/ad-hoc recordings.
  - Error handling: 502 with logged detail on Graph delivery failure; missing Graph token returns 401 instead of fake stub success; UI shows retryable email failure without losing recording.
  - Stub provider remains available for direct unit tests, but the API endpoint requires a Graph token for user-visible email delivery.
  - All email actions audit-logged with recipients.
  - Verification: `scripts/verify-email-jira-flow.py`; live no-token smoke now returns `401 Outlook sign-in is required` instead of fake success.
  - Commit: `7d1197c`

- [x] `IN-72` — UI cleanup: remove per-calendar-meeting Record button
  - Per-calendar Record button absent — whole meeting list/view removed per IN-73.

- [x] `IN-74` — UI cleanup: remove full meeting detail page
  - MeetingReviewScreen, MeetingsScreen removed from App. Navigation removed.
  - Transcript/summary/waveform/speaker review/export all removed.

- [x] `IN-75` — UI cleanup: remove action items view
  - ActionItemsScreen removed from App and navigation.
  - Dashboard action items card removed from HomeScreen.

- [x] (IN-73) Dashboard cleanup
  - UpcomingCard (calendar strip), RecordingsCard, ActionItemsCard removed from HomeScreen.
  - Navigation reduced to Home, People, Settings.
  - Manual recording controls, audio setup, capture/status UI preserved.
  - Commit: `e225a21`

- [x] `IN-81` — Packaging, signing, and installer update
  - Version bumped to 1.0.0 reflecting Slice 1 completion.
  - electron-builder.yml updated: Intune Win32 note per DV, backend/.env/scripts excluded from package.
  - `npm run package:dir` verified — builds cleanly, no secrets or local artefacts in asar.
  - Release workflow and signing left for CI (cert required).
  - AGENTS.md updated with Slice 1 delivered features and remaining blockers.
  - Commit: `336a47e`

- [x] `IN-68` — Implement MS Graph meeting detection
  - All code implemented and fixture-verified: Graph client, filter, normaliser, time/poller, runtime with polling + resume, MSAL public-client auth, interactive sign-in.
  - Live smoke validated 2026-06-29:
    - Interactive MSAL sign-in succeeded with old Entra app registration IDs mapped to v2 env vars (`MN_ENTRA_CLIENT_ID`, `MN_ENTRA_TENANT_ID`).
    - Delegated Graph `/me/calendarView` returned real Teams meeting events.
    - Detection identified `isOnlineMeeting: true`, `onlineMeetingProvider: 'teamsForBusiness'`, `isOrganizer: true`.
    - Host gate passed (organiser verified).
    - Auto-record triggered, renderer confirmed recording started.
    - Auto-stop timer scheduled to meeting end time.
    - Post-sign-in immediate sync verified (no 5-minute startup delay).
    - Start-window gating added (`START_WINDOW_MS = 180000` / 3 min) — events >3 min away receive `not_due_yet`; only eligible within the window.
    - Duplicate/spam protection: idempotency keys prevent re-recording the same event; completed keys tracked in state machine.
    - Delta query support documented for future optimisation; webhooks remain unnecessary for Slice 1.
    - `npm run verify:graph`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run build`, `git diff --check` all pass.
  - Remaining items reserved for packaging verification with signed installer:
    - Verify auto-recording triggers from a cold Windows startup (tray + background).
    - Verify auto-stop timer fires correctly on meeting end.
    - Verify `.webm` saved, uploaded, and backend pipeline processes it.
  - Commits: `cf2a475`, `a59bd92`, `bb33e2c`

## Test items to satisfy later

- [x] `IN-85` — Manual recording still works for in-room/ad-hoc use
  - Tested with actual 97 KB .webm recording file (ace1afd2...).
  - Full pipeline: create → upload → process → ready → review → finalise → email.
  - Transcript text is stub (PyannoteAI API not configured), but data flow works.
  - Verified: 2026-06-26 with curl against recording-backed meeting 855eec39.

- [x] `IN-87` — Unregistered speaker stored as anonymous in output
  - Unknown 1 stored with `speaker_known: false` in participants array.
  - Flagged in `unknown_speaker_count` and finalise guard (409).
  - Verified: review endpoint returns participant `{name: "Unknown 1", known: false}`.

- [x] `IN-88` — Per-meeting calendar Record button absent; manual controls and audio setup present
  - Navigation: Home, People, Settings only. No meeting detail/action items UI.
  - HomeScreen: CaptureCard (start/upload), recording status banner, no calendar/recordings cards.
  - Settings → Audio Setup preserved.
  - Verified: `npm run typecheck` + `npm run build` + `git diff --check` all pass.

- [x] `IN-94` — When a transcript is saved it is sent via email attachment to the correct persons
  - Backend accepts email once transcript is saved and pipeline is `ready`.
  - Calendar-linked recipient resolution uses Graph attendee emails, deduped case-insensitively.
  - Manual/ad-hoc recipient resolution falls back to the signed-in recorder email.
  - Renderer automatically emails after the ready poll succeeds and shows transcript emailed / retry states.
  - Verified: email endpoint returns `{recipients: [...], sent_at: ...}`; live smoke returned `joseph@example.com` for a manual recording.
